# placed *after* TPM's own `run`, so bindings that overlap with other plugins
# (notably tmux-yank's copy-mode keys) resolve in this plugin's favour.
#
# This script only does the parts that depend on user options; the key tables
# themselves live in vim-modes.conf and are loaded through tmux's own parser,
# because chained (`\;`) bindings cannot survive being built in a shell.

# `pane_in_mode` rather than `pane_mode == copy-mode` so that the other pane
# modes a leader key can open — a chooser, the clock, `prefix ?` — read as
# VISUAL too; what they have in common is that typing does not reach the shell,
# which is the thing the indicator is there to tell you.

# chainable. Two bindings need it: Escape, which such a pane wants for its own

# --- the leader ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The leader is tmux's own prefix, whatever the user set it to, and its commands
# live in tmux's own `prefix` key table. The option itself has to be parked on
# None though: tmux's built-in prefix check only fires while the client is on
# the *default* key table, which in this plugin is INSERT, so a live
# `prefix Space` would swallow the space bar mid-sentence. NORMAL reaches the
# table through an ordinary binding instead.
#
# The key is remembered in @vim-modes-leader so a reload — which re-runs this
# script against the None we ourselves set — doesn't lose it. Dropping the
# `set -g prefix` line from tmux.conf therefore keeps the last leader until the
# server restarts; set the option to the key you want rather than deleting it.

# The trip back to NORMAL after a leader command, as a command alias so the

# leave the client on root for that mode's key table to be reachable at all, and
# pane-mode-changed returns those to NORMAL when the mode ends.

# Give every binding already in the prefix table that same return: tmux resets
# the key table to the default (root, i.e. INSERT) once a prefix command
# finishes, so without this, stock keys like `prefix ?` and other plugins'
# bindings would quietly drop you into INSERT. list-keys prints valid tmux
# syntax, so the table can be read out, extended and sourced back in. Bindings
# that already carry the return are skipped, which keeps reloads from stacking
# it up.
#
# `-r` (repeat) is dropped along the way. A repeat binding leaves the client
# flagged as repeating, and tmux sends a repeating client back to the *default*
# table on the next key regardless of what the binding switched to — so
# `prefix Left` would move a pane and then silently drop you into INSERT. The
# repeat itself is already gone once the return fires after the first press;
# dropping the flag is what keeps the mode right. NORMAL's own HJKL covers the
# resizing this mattered for.
#
# A binding that *starts* with confirm-before (stock `&` is the one that
# matters) gets the return put in front as well: confirm-before suspends the
# chain until the prompt is answered and answering with Escape drops the rest,
# so a trailing return alone would never run on a cancel and would strand the
# client in INSERT. Leaving the trailing one on too is harmless — on the
# confirmed path it just re-asserts a mode already set.
